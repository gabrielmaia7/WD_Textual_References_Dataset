<p>The African and  Middle Eastern Division (AMED) was created in 1978 as part of a general Library of  Congress reorganization. For AMED it combined three sections --  African, Hebraic, and Near East, which cover 77 countries  and regions from Southern Africa to the Maghreb and from the  Middle East to Central Asia.</p>
<p> On August 3, 2020, the Library of Congress appointed <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-20-049/library-of-congress-appoints-new-chief-of-african-and-middle-eastern-division/2020-08-03/">Lanisa Kitchiner</a> as chief of the division. She is responsible for directing the division's three sections. Each section plays a vital role  in the Library's acquisitions program; offers expert reference  and bibliographic services to the Congress and researchers in this  country and abroad; develops projects, special events, and  publications; and cooperates and participates with other  institutions and scholarly and professional associations in the US and  abroad.</p>
<p>Although  proposed earlier, it was not until 1960, with national academic and government interest  mounting about sub-Saharan Africa, that the African Section was  established, administered initially by the General Reference and  Bibliography Division. The section focuses on virtually all topics relating  to sub-Saharan Africa. The Hebraic Section began operation in 1914  as part of the Division of Semitic and Oriental Literature, and  concentrates on Jewish culture, Israel, the Hebrew language, Biblical  studies, and the ancient Near East. Its founding may be traced to  Jacob Schiff's gift in 1912 of about 10,000 Hebraica books and pamphlets  from the collection of a well-known bibliographer and  bookseller.</p>
<p>In 1945, the Near East Section was created as part of  the Orientalia Division to serve as a focal point of the Library's  programs for this pivotal area. It covers North Africa, the Arab  world, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, Central   Asia, and Islam. Volumes about  Africa and the Middle East were in one of the  first major purchases by the Library  of Congress, the 1815 acquisition of the Thomas Jefferson library;  the subject and linguistic range of which greatly influenced future  Library acquisitions policy. Although sporadic receipts of  publications from and about the region were reported in annual reports  of the Librarian of Congress, there was limited systematic  acquisition effort on this part of the world prior to World War II.</p>
<p>Today, AMED is recognized as a major world resource center for Africa, the  Middle East, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The Hebraic and  Near East sections have custody of material in  the non-Roman-alphabet languages of  the region. Included in these collections are books,  periodicals, newspapers, microforms, and rarities including cuneiform  tablets, manuscripts, incunabula (works printed before 1501) and other  early African and Middle Eastern publications; in 2019, together  they number over 650,000 volumes. The Hebraic Section collections  contain more than 280,000 volumes in Hebrew and related languages,  including Yiddish, Ladino, Syriac, and the languages of Ethiopia.  Materials in more than 35 languages are held by the Near East Section,  the major holdings of which are Arabic (the largest, with more  than 250,000 volumes), Persian, Turkish, Central Asian  (in indigeneous languages), Armenian, and Georgian. While the African Section has no  formal custodial responsibilities, it maintains a pamphlet  collection of about 40,000 items.To enhance  further holdings already strong in the fields of history, literature, economics,  linguistics, art, religion and philosophical studies, division curators  participate in acquiring materials of research value via purchase,  copyright, exchange, and gift. Noteworthy grants and gifts have  also served to strengthen these collections. For example, in  1960, a grant from the Carnegie Corporation provided initial  support for the African Section, including staff travel to many  African countries to obtain publications for the  collections. A gift of two Deinard collections, the last received in 1921, and  which total nearly 20,000 volumes,substantially increased the  Hebraica collections. Generous gifts from Mr. And Mrs. Arthur Dadian  in the 1990s created an endowment of now $783,000, to develop and  maintain the Library's Armenian holdings.In the spring  of 1997, the Division moved from the John Adams Building to its present location  in the Thomas Jefferson Building.</p>
<p>The new AMED reading room houses  a 6,500 volume reference collection and a rotating  display of current events journals, arranged and maintained by each  of the three sections. Researchers may consult specialists who  readily provide in-depth reference assistance in identifying  materials in their custodial collection as well as related sources about  Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Central   Asia in Roman script and in other formats or specializations found in the  Library of Congress general collections and in other units such as the  Geography and Map Division, the Manuscript Division, the Rare  Book and Special Collections Division, and the Law Library.In the several  display cases in its imposing reading room, the Division mounts small exhibits. Major  exhibits featuring AMED collections have been mounted in the Library's  galleries. "From Haven to Home: 350 Years of Jewish Life in America,"  was prepared to mark the 350th anniversary of the first Jewish  settlement in America, and a version of this exhibit later traveled to several  North American cities and is available for viewing on the web at <a href="//www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome">http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome</a></p>
<p>Special events  and outreach activities have long been part of the Division's agenda. It hosts numerous  library organizations and programs. The Africana Librarians Council of the  African Studies Association has held several of its semiannual meetings at the  Library, as have the Middle East Librarian Association, the Association of  Jewish Libraries and the International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies. </p>
<p>The Division  also holds a number of cultural and scholarly programs and conferences every  year. Among the many programs organized by the Near East section in 2007 was the  13th Annual Vardanants Day Armenian Lecture on “U.S. and Armenian  Foreign Relations: A Conversation with the First Five U.S. Ambassadors to  Armenia;” and an international symposium on  Alisher Novo’i, the national Uzbek poet, and his influence on Central Asian  cultures and nations. In 2008 the Near East section planned and hosted a  major conference on “Education, Health and Socio-Economic Developments in Iraq  Today,” that brought together numerous organizations working in Iraq that  contributed their reports to the Library’s collections on Iraq. The Hebraic  section holds regular lecture series on topics related to its collections  including the annual Myron M. Weinstein Memorial Lectures on the Hebraic Book,  which in 2007 included a presentation by Zachary M. Baker entitled “A  Bibliographer Encounters the Muses: Reflections on the Yiddish Theater and its  Legacy,” and in 2008 a lecture by Marsha M. Rozenblit, Harvey M. Meyerhoff  Professor of Modern Jewish History at the University of Maryland, on  “Traditional Judaism or Reform? The Case of the Mannheimer Prayer Book in  Nineteenth-Century Vienna.”  The section also includes Ethiopia,  and in 2007, it held a yearlong set of lectures, music programs, films and other  cultural activities on the occasion of the new Ethiopian Millennium. The  African section hosts numerous programs as well, and in 2007 it held an all day  symposium on the occasion of the 160th anniversary of the  independence of Liberia entitled “Liberian-United States Relations: Past,  Present and Future,” at which Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. participated, and  in 2008 it hosted &nbsp;Steve McDonald of the  Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars who gave a presentation on  “Training Leaders for Peace Building in Burundi.”</p>
<p>Another role of  the Division is to facilitate projects that enhance access to the collections. In  2006, the Near East section completed a two year project to digitize, annotate  and mount on the Library of Congress’ website 355 Arabic, Persian and Ottoman  calligraphy sheets that date from the 9th to the 19th  centuries and that had never been available to the public before. An online  presentation of 38 Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets, cones and brick fragments  dating back more than 4,000 years, and held by the Hebraic section, can now be  accessed by researchers inside and outside the Library. Manuscripts from Timbuktu, never seen in  the West before, were identified by African section staff, digitized and  annotated, and are now accessible on the Library’s website.&nbsp; &nbsp;The  publications issued under the auspices of the Division form a widely acclaimed body of  material. The African Section has compiled more than 40 publications  ranging from official publications of African nations to short subject  guides on contemporary issues such as <em>Abuja:  The New Federal Capital of Nigeria</em>.  Titles prepared in the Near East Section include <em>The  Holy Koran</em> <em>at the Library of Congress</em> and <em>American Dissertations on  the Arab World</em>. The catalog of the highly successful exhibit  initiated by the Hebraic Section in 2004, appears as <em>From Haven to Home: 350  Years of Jewish Life in America.</em></p>
<p>The African and  Middle Eastern Division continues to exert a vital influence in the development of  area studies librarianship. Its specialists represent the  Library at key cooperative area studies programs in which it is an  institutional member, such as the Cooperative Africana Project,  and the Middle East Microform Project. Division staff is recognized for  scholarly publications; serve as officers in area studies  organizations; and attend and participate in national and international  meetings on their areas of expertise. Additionally, a contribution of  significance by AMED is its training of young scholars and future  librarians through briefings, presentations, internships and  volunteer positions, and mentoring to promising candidates, thus  guaranteeing the future success in the study of these vital areas in  world culture.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
