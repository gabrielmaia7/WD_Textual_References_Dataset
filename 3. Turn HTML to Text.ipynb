      "41 P. R. Godavarma Raja was born on 13 October 1908 at Poonjar in Kottayam district of Kerala, into the Royal House of Poonjar.\n",
      "42 He was the third son of Smt.\n",
      "43 Ambalika Thamburatty, a lady belonging to the Poonjar dynasty, and her Sambandam husband, Puthusseri Narayanan Nampoothiri.\n",
      "44 His mother belonged to the Nair caste and, as a member of the Poonjar dynasty, was of noble birth, while his father, Sri P.N. Nampoothiri, was a high-caste Namboodiri Brahmin.\n",
      "45 In accordance with the Sambandam system and the matrilineal Marumakkathayam system then prevalent in Kerala, Godavarma Raja belonged not to the family and caste of his father, but to that of his mother; he was a member of the Poonjar dynasty, and similarly, his children would belong to the family of their mother, whatever that might be.\n",
      "46 The Poonjar dynasty traces its lineage to the Pandyan kings of the Sangam Age.\n",
      "47 The founder of the dynasty, Manavikrama Kulashekhara Perumal, was a Pandyan king whose mother was a Chera princess.\n",
      "48 In 1152 AD, he shifted from Madurai (the Pandya capital) to present-day Kerala due to incessant civil wars in the Tamil Country.\n",
      "49 Arriving in the land of his mother, Raja Manavikrama Perumal purchased the land that covers present day Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Idukki districts from the Thekkumkur Rajas and thus established a small fiefdom for himself.\n",
      "50 In his flight from Madurai, he and his family had carried with them one of the three idols of Meenakshi, their \"Kula Devatha.\"\n",
      "51 This idol, which had been used in Madural as the \"Utsava Murthy\" during the annual car festival of Meenakshi Sundareswara, was now installed by Manavikrama Perumal as the \"Pratishtha\" (main idol) in the Meenakshi temple which he built on the banks of the Meenachil river.\n",
      "52 The family has thus lived in Poonjar for nearly a thousand years, and their lives have revolved around this temple and the small fiefdom which surrounds it.\n",
      "53 The town of Erattupetta was the commercial center of the Poonjar kingdom.\n",
      "54 G. V. Raja completed his school education at S.M.V. High School, Poonjar and MD Seminary Higher Secondary School, Kottayam.\n",
      "55 He then went to Madras to pursue a degree in Medicine.\n",
      "56 Marriage.\n",
      "57 Goda Verma's wife, Rani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, Rani of Attingal and Travancore.\n",
      "58 Goda Varma's elder brother, Rama Varma, was married to Bhawani Amma Tampuratti, whose sister Sethu Parvathi Bayi was the Amma Maharani (queen mother) of Travancore.\n",
      "59 It was Rama Varma and Bhawani Amma who suggested that Goda Varma may be a suitable husband for the queen mother's daughter.\n",
      "60 The royal family agreed and made a formal proposal of marriage to Goda Varma's parents.\n",
      "61 When the marriage proposal from the Travancore Royal Family reached him, as a prospective bridegroom for Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, the Queen of Travancore, G.V Raja was studying in Madras for attaining a degree in Medicine.\n",
      "62 He accepted the marriage proposal, discontinuing his education.\n",
      "63 On 24 January 1934, at the age of 26, he married the then 17-year-old Maharani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi with whom he had four children.\n",
      "64 Elayarajah (Crown Prince)\n",
      "65 Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma (1938-1944), died at the age of six of a rheumatic heart condition.\n",
      "66 Pooyam Thirunal Gowri Parvati Bayi (born 1941)\n",
      "67 Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi (born 1945), Indo Anglian writer, Maharaja Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma Sree Padmanabha Dasa Vanchipala, Maharaja of Travancore (born 1949).\n",
      "68 After he settled down to royal duties with his wife in Trivandrum, G.V Raja started his military career in the Travancore State Force as a Captain of the Nair Brigade.\n",
      "69 The Maharajah entrusted him with the additional responsibility of receiving and dealing with foreign dignitaries and important state guests.\n",
      "70 He was also appointed as the head of the sports and tourism departments of the then royal government.\n",
      "71 He served in the military till 1949 and retired as a Lt. Colonel.\n",
      "72 Contributions.\n",
      "73 G. V. Raja practiced and promoted sports in Kerala.\n",
      "74 He was involved in sports promotion, tourism, the aviation industry, and establishing the necessary infrastructure for the promotion of all these varied fields.\n",
      "75 Tourism promotion.\n",
      "76 After their wedding, G.V. Raja and his wife had spent their honeymoon at Kovalam.\n",
      "77 During this time, G.V Raja had become smitten by the beauty of the place and in later tears, even referred to Kovalam as his \"first love\".\n",
      "78 Since he had a prominent place in public administration as the Maharani's husband, he decided to develop and promote Kovalam as a tourist destination, and then expanded his interest to other places of tourist interest within Travancore.\n",
      "79 He started Kerala Travels Limited to popularize various key tourist locations in the Travancore Kingdom.\n",
      "80 When Travancore merged with India, Kerala Travels Limited became a private (corporate) entity under his ownership.\n",
      "81 In the 1960s, KTL collaborated with Thomas Cook and started popularizing Kovalam in western countries, and this resulted in kick-starting the hippie culture in Kovalam Beach, something which he never wanted and never thought would happen.\n",
      "82 He invited many foreign dignitaries and promoted the place by organising parties at the Kovalam Palace, according to Kerala Tourism Development Corporation website.\n",
      "83 He also took the initiative to develop the Trivandrum Airport.\n",
      "84 Sports promotion.\n",
      "85 The \"Kerala for you\" web site reports that G. V. Raja established the All India Sports Council in 1954, the first of its kind in the country.\n",
